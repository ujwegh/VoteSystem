Stack technology Spring MVC, Spring Data-Jpa, Spring Security, Hibernate, Logback, 
Json Jackson, Apache Tomcat, Ehcache, JUnit, Hamcrest, slf4j

The task is:

#### Build a voting system for deciding where to have lunch.
* 2 types of users: admin and regular users
 * Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
 * Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
 * Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
 * Only one vote counted per user
 * If user votes again the same day:
    - If it is before 11:00 we asume that he changed his mind.
    - If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed

Each restaurant provides new menu each day.
   
To deploy you need Maven, Java JDK8, Tomcat 8.5+, Intellij IDEA, POSTMAN
